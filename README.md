# WhatsApp-Chat-Visualizer
A simple tool to graph and visualize trends in your WhatsApp Groups.


## How to use?

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the source code through the GitHub website, or take a pull of this repository.
3. Open the terminal in the directory where you have the .py file, and run it using `python3 wcv.py` (you might have to use python or py3 instead of python3).
4. Enter path of the zip file from your WhatsApp export
  - To get this export, navigate to WhatsApp (preferably on your phone).
  - Choose which group you would like to analyze, and open that chat
  - Go the the 3 dots in the top right, and choose More -> Export Chat, and send that to your PC however you like.
  - This is the path of the file that you should pass to this script.



This is a very primitive tool, that I built just for fun and to see some trends in some WhatsApp chats.

I would love to continue working on this in the future by making this an Android app, for which you simply share the export and then it works.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)
